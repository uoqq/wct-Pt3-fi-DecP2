    The Emergence of a new Cult in Society - Classic Cars as Status Symbols
    In 1885, Carl Benz turned over a new leaf in the history of mobility and was granted a patent for the first
    automobile. The technique evolved with new makes and models like the Ford Tin Lizzie and the Mercedes-Benz
    300
    SL over the past 100 years. Some of the tedious models from the past turned into popular classic Car models
    over
    the years - European cars like the Volkswagen Beetle, Citroen 2CV or Jaguar XK and other "oldies" are good
    examples for this nostalgic value.
    Over 2.500 manufacturers produced a countless number of different car models over the past 100 years. It is
    not
    that easy to tell what makes a certain car so special, even decades after the production shut down.
    Sometimes it
    depends on the car body as such, sometimes a famous driver increased the popularity of a certain car model.
    Good
    examples for cars that made an astonishing image change are the European Opel Kadett or classic muscle cars
    from
    the US. Those pragmatic but fuel consuming cars were widely disliked for years - today, there is a huge fan
    community for old and restored muscle cars and standard models from Europe and they are popular collectibles
    for
    every automobile fan.
